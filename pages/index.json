    "primary": "Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dennis, an upcoming computer science grad at UCI actively seeking software engineering opportunities. This past summer, my passion for software engineering grew significantly as I learned to write high-quality code at my software engineering internship and completed multiple personal projects. I take pride in producing well-documented, scalable code and continuously strive to incorporate professional coding practices. I'm always eager to learn new concepts and share insights with others.",
